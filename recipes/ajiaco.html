        <h5>Ajiaco is one of the many regional Colombian dishes you can’t leave the country without trying. It’s a hearty soup made from three different kinds of potatoes, chicken, guasca leaves, with a half an ear of corn splashed in for good measure. Most times, Ajiaco is accompanied by a plate of rice and a slice of avocado. </h5>
